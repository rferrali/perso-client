# My personal website

This project was made with [Angular](https://angular.io/). I made it because I was frustrated with OpenScholar and other academic CMSs. This app has several useful features for academic websites, including global management of people (create a person once, and then add it as a coauthor, instructor), complete yet simple management of publications (drag and drop to reorder,  sort into categories, and easily create buttons and categories, simple citation export), and tracking of abstract clicks and paper downloads through Google Analytics. 

Feel free to fork the project and improve upon it!
